This branch contains the experiment 'delete_cost_metabolite'. It do the same as
'replicating old results' but excluding the enzymatic cost part of the model

Summary
- The network have few modifications:
    - Original costs (Only was eliminated for exchanges and biomass equation)
    - The bounds was change using fva analysis
    - The Niklas Biomass was used
    - The A1AT synthesis was simulated
    - A Custom ATP Demand was used
    - All the stoichiometric coefficients of the cost metabolite are set to zero

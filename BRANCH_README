a very similar, or equal, setup than the julia0.6 package. 

Summary
- The network have few modifications:
    - Original costs (Only was eliminated for exchanges and biomass equation)
    - The bounds was change using fva analysis
    - The Niklas Biomass was used
    - The A1AT synthesis was simulated
    - A Custom ATP Demand was used
